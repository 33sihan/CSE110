## PROJECTS
### Ray tracer Program (Mar 2024)
* Developed a ray tracer application in C++ with a focus on implementing precise ray-object intersection
algorithms to accurately render realistic 3D scenes
* Implemented point light and directional light models by calculating diffuse and specular components to
simulate real-world lighting scenarios and achieve visually stunning highlights and glossy effects
### Bookkeeping WeChat Mini Programs (Full Stack) (July 2023 â€“ Jan 2024)
* Designed a full stack bookkeeper mini program that tailored for young women, featuring a sleek and
minimalistic pink-themed interface and dedicated to personal finance management by WXML, WXSS and
JavaScript
* Created two distinct pages for expense tracking and income recording; Introduced a built-in calculator model
on each page, allowing users to input amounts directly without switching to their device's calculator
### Memory Allocation System Development in C (Feb 2023)
* Implemented dynamic memory allocation function on heap using C to optimize resource utilization based on
the best-fit policy and applied pointer arithmetic as well as bitwise operations to calculate memory addresses
of adjacent blocks and represent block allocation status
* Constructed deallocation function to validate and mark the corresponding memory block as free while
optionally coalesce adjacent free blocks to optimize memory usage
